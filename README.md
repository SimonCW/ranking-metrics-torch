# ranking-metrics-torch

This is a small set of PyTorch-based CPU and GPU friendly implementations of common ranking metrics.

Included metrics:

* Precision/Recall
* Average Precision
* Discounted Cumulative Gain
* Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain

Implementations are tested against `scikit-learn` with `hypothesis` property-based testing (where possible.)
